so now this will demonstrate what happens when we branch off. To make a new branch:
git checkout -b newBranch 
or 
git branch - u newBranch

//newBranch is just the name i used for my newBranch, the name can be anything you wish
now from here to start adding to the newBranch, i should be able to just push as normal
